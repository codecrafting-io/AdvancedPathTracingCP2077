This repository is for the development of the [Cyber Engine Tweaks](https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyber-engine-tweaks) based mod for the game [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.cyberpunk.net/). This mod enables key advanced controls for Path Tracing, all now available through a native UI thanks to [Native Settings](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3518).

**NOTE:** This is a **Work In Progress** mod, so things may improve in the future.

## Features

- Control Path Tracing with the following modes:
  - **ReGIR DI/GI**: Reservoir-based Grid Importance Sampling, is a world space light sampling on top of ReSTIR. Often looks and performs better, but can be noisier
  - **ReSTIR DI/GI**: Reservoir SpatioTemporal Importance samples for Global Illumination, is a screen space light sampling used to illuminate secondary surfaces. This is the vanilla mode
  - **ReSTIR DI**: This is the older PT from update 2.0, used for DI only. Allows control of rays per pixel and bounces per ray. Allows control of rays per pixel and bounces per ray
- Control Path Tracing internal settings to set the following levels of quality:
  - **Vanilla**: Default game quality
  - **Performance**: Faster but noisier
  - **Balanced**: Improve on Vanilla quality and increase performance by until 1%
  - **Quality**: Heavy but less noise and higher quality
  - **Psycho**: Flatline your GPU ðŸ’€
- Path Tracing Optimizations: Enables small path tracing optimizations without relevant quality loss
- Control number of rays per pixel and rays per bounce when using **ReSTIR DI** mode
- Enable V self reflection.
- Enable DLSS ray reconstruction particles in raytracing. By default, the game separates particles for RR, so enable this if it's not raining or it's indoors
- Disable NRD Denoiser helper for Ray Reconstruction. Path Tracing has two main denoisers, RR and NRD, so using RR should disable NRD, but sometimes it enables, this helps to keep NRD disabled over time
- Auto Refresh game when loading and exiting the menu. The game has a tendency to not have "full performance" when loading or exiting menus, this helps to mitigate the problem by pausing the game for a few seconds. This is disabled by default

**NOTE:** ReGIR DI/GI mode on Cyberpunk 2077 has activation issues, requiring multiple enable/disable timed cycles, and performance takes up to 30s to stabilize, if not reload the save or restart the game, especially after disabling. Using Auto Refresh Game or entering and exiting photo mode also may help.

**NOTE:** This mod is will designed for Path Tracing (PT), not normal Ray Tracing (RT). So quality levels, optimizations are only for PT and won't affect RT.
